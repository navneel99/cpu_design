Week11 - Ritvik Vij and Navneel Mandal
(2017CS50417 & 2017CS50414)

In this week we implemented the shift operations required for LAB8 and completed extending the DP instructions.

Shift instructions implemented was using the fact that shift can be expressed as a sum of numbers which are a powers of 2,using multiplexers whether to use the specified shifter or not as discussed in class.

Debugging remains and DT instructions will also be added to implementation as the week progresses.

All DP instructions excluding compare instructions and branch instructions are working.This has to be fixed.
